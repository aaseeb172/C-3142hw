Lab 3: to run do 
cd lab3
cd src
make lab3

i have most of the code however due to a runtime error with my input i could not figure out why my vectors were empty but still most of the assignment has been completed just could not fix this error.

program description: use classes and structures to access records of classes and be able to provide average pass rates based on terms, instructors, and by class as well.

problem solving: i was able to do the logical element of the program however due to a runtime error which left my input blank and my vectors filled with no values i could not do the rest of the assignment due to not being able to figure out the reason behind it.

Problem description:
  lab 2 was using struct and enum in order to make a simple calculator that can handle 5 simple operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Along with automating it through the use of Makefiles, the task of making the calculator was based on having the operations and being able to make sure the right input is put for each operation that it wants.
  
 Problem solving: looking at a simple calculator that you can get from the store, i realized that enum would be used to store the operations and the structure would hold the methods and calculations for each operation we have presented. And in our main we have if statements to check what operation it is according to each operation input is taken in accordiningly and a answer is given as well.
